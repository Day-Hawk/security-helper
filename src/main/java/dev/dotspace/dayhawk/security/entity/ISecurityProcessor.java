/**
 * The {@code ISecurityProcessor} interface defines the contract for a security processor,
 * which may encompass various security-related operations and functionalities.
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes are expected to provide specific implementations for different security aspects
 * such as encryption, decryption, key management, and other security-related operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface serves as a common abstraction for security-related functionalities,
 * allowing for flexibility and customization in different security scenarios.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ISecurityProcessor securityProcessor = // Create an instance of a class implementing ISecurityProcessor
 *
 * // Perform security-related operations
 * // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface may include cryptographic processing, secure key management, authentication,
 * and other security measures, depending on the specific requirements and use cases.</p>
 *
 * @author Day-Hawk
 * // Add additional references based on specific functionalities
 */
public interface ISecurityProcessor {
  // Define methods and functionalities specific to the security processor.
